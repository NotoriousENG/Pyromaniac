[NAME=???] Hello Py Fieri!

My name is Peabody von Peavington

[NAME=Peaobody] It looks like that chicken has stolen your underwear!

You must follow it! It looks like it is heading to Lit City Hall.

Or as the kids call it, Lity Hall.

You'll have to pass several obstacles on your way!

Be sure to CTRL your powers or Click-Left into them!

Also there are two meters you need to know about within your soul.

There is your Passion meter which represents your livelihood in three flame segments.

And there is your Spirit meter which is fueled by victory and defeat.

You can use some of your spirit meter to heal by pressing into your inner 'H' key.
