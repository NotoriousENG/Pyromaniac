[NAME=???]Hi I'm Grapey's brother, Winey!

[NAME=WINEY] Sorry I'm not that interesting.

I wish I could light that torch to unlock the elevator.

I guess I can't usurp the local govenment without going through this Hall
 and finding a mystical stone that allows me to shoot fireballs.

If I could shoot fireballs, I would probably do so by using my ALT-ernate powers
that I just have to Click-Right into.

Then I could easily catch that chicken.
